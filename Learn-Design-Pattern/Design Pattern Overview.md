According to these authors design pattern are primarily based on the following principles of object orientated design.

* Program to an interface not an implementation
* Favor object composition over inheritance

## Usage of Design Pattern

Design patterns have two main usages in software development.

### Common paltform for developers

Design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenario. For example, a singleton design pattern signifies use of single object so all developers familar with single design pattern will make use of single object and they can tell each other that program is following a singleton patter.

### Best Practices

Design patterns have been evolved over a long period of time and the provide best solutinos to certain problems faced during software development. Learning these patterns helps un-experienced developers to learn software design in an easy and faster way.

## Types of Design Pattern

As per the design pattern reference book **Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software**, there are 23 design patterns. These patterns can be classified in three categories: Creational, Structural and behavioral patterns. We'll also disuss anthoer category of design patterns: J2EE design patterns.

1.  **Creational Patterns**  
    These design patterns provides way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given user case.

2.  **Structural Patterns**  
    These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities. 

3.  **Behavioral Patterns**  
    These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

4.  **J2EE Patterns**
    These design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier. These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.
